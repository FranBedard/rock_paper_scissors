# rock_paper_scissors

Rock, paper, scissors project.

As of right now this game will be played through the console and later I will add a GUI.

Steps:

1. Create a function called getComputerChoice, that randomly returns rock, paper, or scissors.

2. Create a function that plays 1 round of rock, paper, scissors.
